# KPIs

*Key Performance Indicator* 

Before giving a definition we would like to clarify the difference between a KPI and a METRIC, because we know that these terms can be confusing.
KPI is a key indicator that is reflected through a metric that has been specifically selected because it is essential to the success of the company or project.
KPIs are the main indicators used to measure progress towards business objectives.

A metric is a quantitative measure of a specific aspect of a company or project. 
It can be a number or a statistic that indicates the performance of a process or activity. This metric is not key to the business/company but it is useful to track the action we are taking.
to track the action it measures.

To make it clearer, let's give an example.

- **Goal**: To increase the reviews of a specific location.
- **Objective**: Increase reviews by 15% within a set timeframe.
- **KPI**: Increase the conversion rate of customers to reviews by 15%.
- **Metric**: Conversion rate of customers to reviews.

In this example, the metric measures current performance in terms of customer conversion rate to reviews, 
while the KPI sets a specific and measurable target to increase the customer-to-review conversion rate within a specific timeframe. 

# Proposed KPIs

* **Increase the response rate by 15% to customer reviews within 6 months**: We believe that a company/location having a high response rate or a higher than average value will bring a greater flow of customers because the project will show initiative for improvement.
or a higher than average value will bring it a greater flow of customers because the project will show initiative for improvement 
by responding to both positive and negative comments. The metric that accompanies this KPI will be the response rate of the venue divided by the total number of reviews.

* **Increase by 10% the reviews in a period of 6 months**: Reviews are very important for a local, this gives greater visibility not only locally but internationally as
well, the fact of being able to increase the level of reviews by a percentage will be fundamental for the growth of the company in the future.
The fact that the level of reviews can be increased by a percentage will be fundamental for the growth of the company in the future.
The metric that accompanies this KPI will be a count of the total reviews received by the store over the established 6-month period.

platforms such as Google Maps and Yelp, this will be reflected in the rating. 
reviews from different platforms such as Google Maps and Yelp, this will be reflected in the rating. The higher the rating, the better positioned the location will 
be in the competition, thus attracting a higher level of customers. The metric that accompanies this KPI is to set an average target value and to monitor the average 
in real time of the until the target is reached.

* **Decrease the level of complaints by 10% within 6 months**: Complaints will be reflected in the negative comments in the customer reviews,
in turn these comments are the key to improve the store, taking these messages as triggers for the customer to have a better experience. What we are looking for
is to lower those levels of negative comments through a constant monitoring of the negative comments that users are leaving and thus be able to take note of them and decrease
and reduce them.

* **Increase by 10% the level of recommendation of the local in 6 months**: In turn, the positive comments are a reflection of the quality of service of the company, 
We seek to increase this percentage of positive messages since this will give us a better position in the market, so that our store will be the most sought after by users.
our local is the most sought after by users. This will be achieved by setting a target value in the fixed term and continuously monitoring the positive comments that are arriving to reach the 
positive comments that are arriving until the goal is reached.
